## Description

Fitness Tracker is a comprehensive web application designed to help users manage their fitness journey through:

- **Exercise Database Management** - Organized categorization of exercises by muscle groups (back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, chest, legs & glutes, calves, core, abs, cardio)
- **Workout Session Tracking** - Create and log detailed workout sessions with exercises, sets, and weights
- **Workout History** - View complete training history with historical snapshots of exercises
- **Progress Analytics** - Generate statistics and visualize progress through volume and strength charts
- **Workout Plans** - Access and execute predefined workout plans with default parameters

The application addresses common pain points in existing fitness tracking solutions by providing:
- Detailed exercise categorization and personalization
- Granular workout parameter tracking (sets + weight)
- Historical snapshots that preserve exercise state at the time of workout creation
- Comprehensive workout planning capabilities

## Project Scope

### MVP Features (Current Phase)

#### Core Functionality
- **Exercise Management (Admin)**
  - Create, read, update, delete exercises
  - Exercise attributes: name, category, image (SVG/PNG), description, YouTube link, muscle groups, difficulty level, equipment type
  - Organized by 10 muscle group categories

- **Workout Management (Users)**
  - Create workouts manually by selecting exercises and specifying sets and weights
  - Create workouts from predefined plans
  - Edit and delete personal workouts
  - View workout history with complete details

- **Workout Plans**
  - Create and manage workout plans with predefined exercises and default parameters
  - Execute workouts based on plans
  - Track completion status for each exercise in a plan

- **Progress Tracking**
  - View workout history with filtering by category and date range
  - Generate volume and strength statistics charts
  - Analyze progress over custom time periods

#### Technical Features
- **Historical Snapshots** - Workouts preserve exercise details (name, description, image, muscle groups) at the time of creation
- **Media Management** - Image hosting via Supabase Storage with support for SVG and PNG formats
- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - User registration and login via Supabase Auth
  - Role-based access control (Admin, User)
